# Nearest Neighbor

This project demonstrates the Nearest Neighbor algorithm through visual sketches. [Click here to see the demo](https://zimquadery.github.io/Nearest-Neighbor/).

## Project Structure

- `classes.js`: Contains custom JavaScript classes used in the sketch.
- `index.html`: The main HTML file that sets up the project structure and includes necessary scripts and styles.
- `jsconfig.json`: Configuration file for JavaScript in the project.
- `libraries/`: Directory containing external libraries used in the project.
- `sketch.js`: The main JavaScript file where the sketch is created and managed.
- `style.css`: The CSS file for styling the HTML elements.

## Getting Started

To run the project, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. This will load the p5.js library, custom classes, and the main sketch script.

## Nearest Neighbor Algorithm

The main focus of this project is to visualize the Nearest Neighbor algorithm. The algorithm is implemented in the [`draw`](sketch.js) function in [sketch.js](sketch.js). It calculates the nearest neighbors for a set of points and visualizes the connections between them.
